# cit-e

cit-e "site-eee" is a site crawler that I've written to analyze websites for HackerOne. 

This crawler can be polite and listen to the robot.txt, or it can be rude and scan everything. 

Coming features:
  - get all input on every page
  - get all output on every page
    - outputs are values that will differ between users 
  - if you would like other features, please post it as a feature-request under issues.
